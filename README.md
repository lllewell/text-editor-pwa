# Text Editor

## Description

As a developer I created an app so that I can produce notes or code snippets with or without the Internet through a text editor. The data in the text editor will also persist through refreshes.


## Installation

The user needs to install the `express` and `webpack` dependencies to utilize this program.

## Usage

Upon running the `npm run start:dev` command, the webpack will be built into the dist folder. Then the app will run on `localhost:3000`. Once in the text editor, text can be added into the browser as well as stored in the IndexDB
